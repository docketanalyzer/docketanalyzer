Deming, being duly sworn, deposes and states:\n\n1. I am a Special Agent with the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI)\nand have been since September 2006 after completing New Agent Training at the\nFBI Academy in Quantico, Virginia. I am assigned to the Plattsburgh Residence\nAgency (RA) to investigate criminal matters within the jurisdiction of the FBI,\nincluding corruption, drug trafficking organizations, money laundering,\nfinancial crimes, extortion and other violent crimes.\n\n2. As part of my current duties, I have become involved in an\ninvestigation of a violation of Title 18, United States Code, Section 1201(c),\nconspiracy to commit kidnapping. This affidavit is made in support of a criminal\ncomplaint charging Graigory BROWN with a violation of Title 18, United States\nCode, Section 1201l{c) (conspiracy to commit kidnapping). The statements in this\naffidavit are based on information provided to me by other law enforcement\nofficers, investigative reports, and my investigation of this matter. I have\nset forth only those facts that I believe are necessary to establish probable\ncause to believe that Graigory BROWN has committed a violation of Title 18,\nUnited States Code, Section 1201 (c).\n\nThe Kidnapping\n\n3. On September 28, 2020, at approximately 6:20 a.m., New York State\nPolice were dispatched to a residence on State Route 95, Town of Moira, Franklin\nCounty, New York, for a report of a burglary and welfare check on the residents\nof that address. Upon arrival at the scene, troopers interviewed Witness-1 who\n\nstated his parents, Victim-1 and Victim-2, lived at the residence. Witness-1\n\fstated his father had not arrived at work that morning, which was odd, so\nWitness-1 attempted to call him, but he was unable to get ahold of Victim-1 and\nVictim-2. Witness-1 stated he went to his parents\u2019 house and found-both their\nvehicles parked at the residence, but the front door had been forced open. A\ntrooper observed the front door had been forcibly opened and the interior of\nthe residence was in disarray, specifically, the bed was unmade and a jar of\ndog treats in the master bedroom had been tipped over in an otherwise neat home.\nA trooper visually checked the residence but was unable to locate Victim-1 or\nVictim-2.\n\n4. An emergency geolocation of Victim-1's cell phone showed the phone\nwas near the intersection of State Route 37 and State Route 95 in the Town of\nBombay, New York on September 27, 2020 at approximately 10:54 p.m. A second\nlocation point was identified at approximately 1:03 a.m. on September 28, 2020,\napproximately 23.16 miles north of the cell phone tower located at 58 Biondo\nLane, North Bangor, New York. This would have placed Victim-1's cell phone in\nSnye, Quebec, Canada, an area on the Canadian side of the Akwesasne Mohawk\nReservation. On September 28, 2020, at approximately 8:55 a.m., agents again\nattempted to ping Victim-1's device but the records indicated that the device\nwas roaming outside the United States.\n\n5. Law enforcement searched for video in the area of the Victims\u2019\nresidence and located outside video footage from a location on State Route 95,\nMoira. At approximately 10:30 p.m. on September 27, 2020, a vehicle can be\nseen coming into view and stopping in front of the Victims\u2019 residence. The\nvehicle appears to be a pickup truck with running lights.\n\nCommunications with Witness-1\n\n6. At approximately 9:30 a.m. on September 28, 2020, Witness-1 received\na phone call from phone number (438) 229-9669 and spoke with Victim-1 briefly.\nThen a male (\u201cCo-conspirator A\u201d) took the phone and stated he had Victim-1 and\nVictim-2 and that they wanted what Individual-1 owes them or in the alternative,\n\n2\n\fthey wanted Individual-1.\n\n7. At approximately 9:32 a.m., Witness-1 received a phone call from\nCo-conspirator A, who stated he didn\u2019t want Victim-1. and Victim-2, but that\nthey wanted Individual-1 because Individual-1 \u201chas our stuff.\u201d Co-conspirator\nA demanded the return of 50 kilograms of cocaine or in the alternative, $3.5\nmillion.\n\n8. Based on my training, experience and knowledge of the case, in\nthis call, Co-conspirator A stated the organization wanted Individual-1\nbecause they believed Individual-1 had stolen 50 kilograms of cocaine. In\nreality, that 50 kilograms of cocaine had been previously seized by the Drug\nEnforcement Administration (DEA). Co-conspirator A demanded the return of\nthe 50 kilograms of cocaine in exchange for the Victims, or if the 50\nkilograms of cocaine were not available, the organization would accept the\nvalue of the 50 kilograms of cocaine, namely $3.5 million, in exchange for\nVictims\u2019 safe return.\n\n9. At approximately 12:11 p.m., Witness-1 received a phone call from\nCo-conspirator A who advised that he had just checked on Victim-1 and Victim-2\nand they were well. The male stated, \u201cBring me [(Indivduai-2] and it\u2019s done\ntonight.\u201d Co-conspirator A also stated, \u201cGet [Individual-1]; you\u2019re fucking\ngold..You get that prick, we\u2019re fuckin\u2019 golden. We\u2019re done tonight.\u201d\n\n10. Based on my training, experience and knowledge of the case, in\nthis call, Co-conspirator A stated the organization wanted Individual-2 in\nexchange for the Victims, again believing that Individual-l and Individual-2\nhad stolen the 50 kilograms of cocaine in the possession of DEA. Co-\nconspirator A then said they preferred to exchange the Victims for\nIndividual-1.\n\n11. At approximately 2:49 p.m., Witness-1 received another phone call\nfrom Co-conspirator A, who told Witness~-1, \u201cGet [Individual-1], it solves\neverything..Grab [Indidivual-1]). I'll give you my number. When I hear you have\n\n3\n\f[Individual-1}], I'l] bring (Victim-1 and Victim-2)..I\u201911 send [Victim-2] back,\nbut I'm keeping [Victim-1]. [Victim-1} is staying here until you get\n[Individual-1] or the stuff. .I need [(Individual-1] as leverage.\u201d\n\n12. Based on my training, experience and knowledge of the case, in this\ncall, Co-conspirator A stated that bringing him Individual-1 solves the\nkidnapping. Co-conspirator A was concerned about Victim-2\u2019s health issues, so\nhe agreed to release her, but made it clear he would keep Victim-1 until he had\nIndividual-1 or the cocaine because he had to use Individual-1 as leverage with\nthe organization.\n\n13. At approximately 4:19 p.m., Witness-1 received another phone call\nfrom Co-conspirator A, who wanted to know if Witness-1 had contacted the police.\nAt approximately 5:52 p.m., Witness-l1 received another phone call from Co-\nconspirator A who stated he was worried the police were watching this phone, so\nhe would call from another phone.\n\n14. Agents were able to receive a \u201cproof of life\u201d photograph of the\nVictims wherein Victim-2 was seated in a chair and Victim-1 was standing next\nto her. There were a number of trees in the background.\n\n15. At approximately 8:43 p.m., Witness-1 received a text message from\nphone number (438) 220-6168, stating, \u201cParents are sleeping. 12PM tomorrow trade\nfor [Individual-1].\u201d\n\nReturn _of the Victims\n\n16. Agents were able to geolocate phone number (438) 220-6168 to a house\nin Snye, Quebec, Canada. On September 29, 2020, Canadian law enforcement\nsurrounded the residence in Snye. Co-conspirator B emerged from the house with\na phone in his hand, which Co-conspirator B threw into the bushes. Co~\nconspirator B stated, \u201cI\u2019m just a messenger. I know the elderly couple is in\nMontreal.\u201d\n\n17. Law enforcement in Canada was able to identify two additional phone\nnumbers involved in the kidnapping. On September 29, 2020, emergency\n\n4\n\fgeolocation of those two phone numbers showed the phones were together at a\nresidence in the eastern townships of Quebec, Canada. At that residence, Surete\nde Quebec were able to observe the same type of chair as the one in which\nVictim-2 was sitting in the \u201cproof of life\u201d photograph. Additionally, the\n\u2018residence had trees near it, consistent with the background of the \u201cproof of\nlife\u201d photograph.\n\n18. Surete de Quebec entered and searched the home and located the\nVictims. Canadian authorities arrested three males at the residence with the\nVictims, Co-conspirators C, D, and E.\n\n19. Victim-2 was interviewed and advised agents, in sum and substance,\nthat four people abducted her and Victim-1 from their home in Moira, New York\non the night of September 27, 2020. Two individuals forcefully entered their\nhome, while the other two remained in a vehicle outside. At some point, the\nVictims had hoods or pillowcases placed over their heads. They were taken from\ntheir residence to a vehicle that transported them to a river, where they were\nplaced in a boat. They were then transported to and held at the residence from\nwhich they were rescued in Quebec\u2019s eastern townships.\n\nInvestigation related to Graigory BROWN\n\n20. During the course of witness interviews on September 28, 2020,\nmembers of law enforcement learned from witnesses that Graigory BROWN had stated\nthat he knew where the Victims were. Law enforcement records list BROWN\u2019s\ntelephone number as (518) 219-3145.\n\n21. On September 29, 2020, the FBI, under exigent circumstances,\nobtained the past 7 days of call detail records (CDRs) for phone number (518)\n219-3145, a phone number belonging to BROWN. Among the CDR records was a report\nproviding distance to tower information, also referred to as a Round Trip Timing\nreport (RTT). The RTT report shows the distance between the cellphone and the\ncellular tower and which of the 120 degree sectors around the cellular tower\n\nthe cellphone was located in when it connected to the tower. The FBI used a\n\n5\n\fsoftware tool to map the cellular activity of BROWN\u2019s cell phone using the RIT\nreport. A call to or from BROWN\u2019s cell phone occurred on September 27, 2020 at\n10:15:33 p.m. That call occurred within the 120 degree sector of the Victims\u2019\nresidence. A call to or from BROWN\u2019s cell phone occurred at 10:48:09 p.m.\nwithin the 120 degree sector of Bombay. As stated above, Victim-1'\u2018s cellphone\npinged in the area of Bombay around the same time. Additionally, a license\nplate reader in the area showed BROWN\u2019s pickup truck, a blue 2016 Dodge Ram\n2500 pickup truck with New York commercial registration 19304MJ, had been in\nthe area at the time of the kidnapping.\n\n22. On September 29, 2020, law enforcement surveillance was able to\nlocate BROWN in Fort Covington, New York. BROWN was in a gold 2004 Nissan\nMaxima and successfully evaded law enforcement surveillance. Law enforcement\nlocated BROWN\u2019s cell phone, with phone number (518) 219-3145, on the shoulder\nof Foy Elder Road in Fort Covington approximately 10 minutes after BROWN evaded\nthem.\n\n23. Law enforcement tracked the Nissan to Witness-2. On September 29,\n2020, a trooper responded to Witness-2's residence and interviewed Witness-2.\nWhile at the property, the trooper observed BROWN\u2019s blue 2016 Dodge Ram 2500\npickup parked in the yard. Witness-2 stated BROWN left the pickup at his\nresidence and borrowed the 2004 Nissan Maxima.\n\n24. BROWN'\u2019s Dodge Ram was towed to SP Malone and secured inside for\nforensic processing. BROWN\u2019s Dodge Ram has running lights consistent with the\ntruck observed outside the Victims\u2019 residence the night they were abducted, as\nseen in the video. During a search of BROWN\u2019s truck, agents recovered a\nscrewdriver that appears consistent with the item used to gain access to the\nVictims\u2019 home.\n\n25. On October 1, 2020, law enforcement located BROWN and took him into\ncustody. BROWN was provided with his Miranda warnings, which he waived and\nagreed to speak with agents. BROWN stated, in sum and substance, that he and\n\n6\n\fhis co-conspirators originally planned to kidnap Individual-1, but determined\nthey could not successfully de so. BROWN then advised his co-conspirators that\nhe knew where the Victims lived. BROWN stated he drove himself and three co-\nconspirators in his pickup truck to the Victims\u2019 residence the night of\nSeptember 27, 2020, whereupon they kidnapped the Victims. BROWN stated the\n\ngroup was armed with two firearms during the kidnapping.\n\nAttested to by the affiant:\n\nCe CTs\nD) mmvre C >_\u2014\nTamara S, Beming\nSpecial Agent\nFederal Bureau of Investigation\n\nI, the Honorable Gary L.

            "plain_text": "To The Honorable Judge Favro:\n\n     My name is Ryan Brown. I am writing on behalf of Graigory Brown; Graigory is my father. My\nfather was everything a dad should be and more. He was dedicated, compassionate and helpful in\nwhatever he was involved in. Growing up I never thought I would be sitting here writing this letter\nbut here I am.\n\n    My life as a kid was probably better than most kids. My father spent countless hours coaching\nme in hockey and baseball. We would travel all over the east coast of the U.S. and Canada just so I\ncould play hockey. This was my passion at the time. He treated everyone that he coached just like\nthey were his own kids. He would go out of his way to make sure that every kid mattered. He\nwould volunteer to let other kids travel with us or even pay for travel expenses like food just\nbecause their parents could not afford it or just because they could not take the time off of work.\nHe was a father figure to more kids than just me. In addition to coaching he was the president of\nMalone Minor Hockey for at least 10 years.\n\n     As I got older and hobbies changed my father introduced me to snowmobile drag racing with\nmy grandfather Ralph (who is now deceased). My father was as dedicated and involved in that just\nlike he was in hockey. He was also on the snowmobile drag racing club for 3 years. Furthermore,\nwe would spend weekends at camp during late summer and fall to get ready for hunting season.\nHe was a very proud and dedicated man to that camp. He was a family and friend oriented man as\nhe would plan cookouts and work bees up at camp.\n\n      Unfortunately, our nation is faced with a huge drug epidemic and it has no boundaries. It\ndoes not matter your financial status, gender, or race it turns people, good people, into something\ndifferent. Drugs take over lives and they do horrible things to family and friends. A few years ago\nmy father was introduced and started using the drug cocaine. That is when everything changed.\nHe became a man that I didn\u2019t know and that I know he wasn\u2019t proud of being. He battled his\naddiction for a few years off and on. After the birth of my son, I believe he got clean for quite\nsome time. Sadly, about a year ago something happened in his life that made him make the choice\nto start using again. He got involved in the wrong people and up and left his family. This time he\nwas into something other than cocaine. I am not aware of the circumstances that led to him\ncommitting this crime. All I know is it was not the father that I knew. The father that raised me\nwould have never even thought about doing something like this. The drugs definitely changed his\nlife for the worse.\n\n     In conclusion, regardless of the challenges he will face moving forward, I am confident that\nmy father will develop new skills needed to make to avoid drug addiction and poor decisions.\nDespite the current case, I still believe that if he was not using drugs he would be dedicated,\nhelpful and compassionate in whatever he does. It is my sincere hope that the court takes this\nletter into consideration at the time of sentencing.\n\nSincerely,\nRyan Brown\nRyan Brown\n\f",

Pandemic, like natural disaster or other emergency, grants this Court the discretion\nto order an ends-of-justice continuance. See United States v. Correa, 182 F.Supp.2d 326, 329\n(S.D.N.Y. 2001) (applying this requirement after the September 11, 2001 attacks and noting that\n\u201cthere is authority for granting [discretionary interests-of-justice exclusions] in the case of public\nemergency caused by a natural catastrophe\u201d). Moreover, due to the restrictions imposed by current\npublic-health concerns, denial of a continuance is likely to deny government counsel reasonable\n\ntime necessary for effective preparation, taking into account the exercise of due diligence. 18\n\n \n\fU.S.C. \u00a7 3161(h)(7)(B)(iv). Furthermore, grand jury preparation necessarily involves close\n\ncontact with witnesses, and close contact between assembled grand jurors, which is inconsistent\n\nwith advice from the Centers for Disease Control and may be hazardous to the health of grand\n\njurors, government counsel, agents and other lay witnesses. In addition to concerns for the health\n\nof current and prospective grand jurors and the ability of the Court to obtain--and maintain--an\n\nadequate number of grand jurors as well as the lack of an opportunity for government counsel to\n\nprepare effectively, an ends-of-justice delay is particularly appropriate here because presentation\n- of this matter to a grand jury involves grand jurors who must travel, putting themselves and others\n\nat risk of infection with the coronavirus. Specifically, grand jurors and witnesses will have to\n\ntravel from disproportionately affected areas of the state to hear the case.\n\n5) For all of these reasons, an exclusion under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3161(h)(7)(A) and (h)(7)(B) (iv) is\n\nappropriate.\n\nReasons Unrelated to the COVID-19 Pandemic\n\n6) Additionally, the government has provided counsel with extensive discovery and time is\n\nneeded to review same. Accordingly, the delay is necessary in order to allow the parties the\n\nreasonable time necessary for effective preparation, taking into account the exercise of due\n\ndiligence (3161(h)(7)(B)(iv)).\n\n7) The parties stipulate and agree that a period of 60 days beginning on and including\n\nDecember 7, 2020 to February 4, 2021 shall be excludable under the Speedy Trial Act pursuant to\n\n18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3161(h)(7)(A) and (h)(7)(B)(iv).\n\nThe undersigned attorneys affirm under penalty of perjury the accuracy of the facts set\n\n' forth above and apply for and consent to the proposed order set forth below.\n\n \n\fDated: December 7, 2020\n\nANTOINETTE T.
