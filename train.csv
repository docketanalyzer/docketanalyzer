"ORDER of USCA (certified copy) as to Thomas Cunningham regarding notice of appeal 117 : Following a jury trial, Thomas Cunningham was found guilty of one count of bank robbery, see 18 U.S.C. 2113(a), and sentenced to 180 months imprisonment, 30 months below his guidelines range of 210 to 240 months. Cunningham appeals, but his appointed counsel has concluded that the appeal is frivolous and moves to withdraw under Anders vs. California, 386 U.S. 738(1967). We review only the issues presented in counsel's facially adequate brief and in Cunningham's response. See Cir. R. 51(b); United States vs. Schuh, 289 F. 3d 968, 973-74 (7th Cir. 2002). Cunningham argues that his sentence was unreasonable. But, as counsel recognizes, the court gave careful consideration to the 18 U.S.C. 3553(a) sentencing factors and believing the guidelines overstated Cunningham's criminal history--imposed a below-guidelnes sentence, so any challenge to the reasonable of the sentence would be frivolous. See United States vs. Chess, 610 F. 3d 965, 967 (7th Cir. 2010). We grant counsel's motion to withdraw and dismiss the appeal. (yap, ) (Entered: 10/01/2010)",[]
